- 👋 Hi, I’m @cosmoshivani
- 👀 I’m interested in all things tech, physics, and nature in general. I love mosses and ferns. It'd be so nice if I could stare at a moss-field rather than a computer screen. But I love learning about computers as well. 
- 🌱 I’m trying to get better at Python and web dev.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cool website projects.
